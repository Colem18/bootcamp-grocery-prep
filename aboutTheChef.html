		<h1>About the Chef</h1>
		<p>Hey all! Hope you are enjoying the recipes. I've really been working hard to provide a very diverse set of foods to appeal to lovers of all cuisines. I'm still working on adding more unique meals to this site, so sit tight for now and I will be out with new content soon :)</p>

		<p>I've always loved food, especially since its a necessity to live. So what better way to share my love of food than to create my own website? And the recipes I have given are all pretty quick, pretty easy, and pretty accesible. I know there are plenty of college students like myself who want to learn to cook, and even more, who want to have good food to eat. I believe this site removes the searching process, especially since it has basically all the food a college student could need. But yeah, hope you like the site.</p>
