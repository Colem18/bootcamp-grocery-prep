			<li>Get your bowl out.</li>
			<li>These next few steps are very important and accidentally mixing up the order could be catasrophic, so pay very close attention.</li>
			<li>Make sure the bowl is empty. No liquids in the bowl. Nada. Zip. Zilch.</li>
			<li>Pour your cereal into the bowl.</li>
			<li>Now that your cereal is in the bowl, you can pour the milk in. Again, make sure the cereal is in the bowl before you pour in the milk</li>
