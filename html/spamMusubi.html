		<ol>
			<li>In a bowl, pour both the soy sauce and brown sugar. A good ratio is 1:1, but it doesn't need to be exact.</li>
			<li>Stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves in to the soy sauce. This is act as a sort of quick and easy teryaki glaze.</li>
			<li>Open your can of spam and put the block on a cutting board.</li>
			<li>There are many molds out there to buy and use at home, but in my personal opinion, the best one is the one that comes with the ingredients. Wash out the can and try to get the inside as clean as possible for minimal mess.</li>
			<li>Get out seran wrap and cut yourself a portion a bit bigger than a square. Place this rectangle on the opening of the spam can.</li>
			<li>Slice the spam into slices. About half an inch should do for the thickness each slice and I usually get around 8 slices from a single can.</li>
			<li>Get out a couple nori sheets and cut them into strips so that each strip is about 1/3 the width of the original sheet.</li>
			<li>Put your pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium.</li>
			<li>Place the slices of spam on the pan and let them cook for a little bit.</li>
			<li>Once they look a bit crispier on one side, flip each spam slice over and brush the soy sauce-sugar glaze onto the upward-facing side of the spam.</li>
			<li>Once again, when the spam slices seem crispy on the new side, flip them over again to cook the glaze into the now bottom side and paint the glaze on new upward facing side.</li>
			<li>Flip the spam one more time to cook the newly applied glaze into the meat.</li>
			<li>Place a generous amount of rice on the seran wrap and push the layer of rice to the bottom of the can. Compact the rice with a fork or a spoon.</li>
			<li>Place a newly cooked spam slice on top of the layer of rice and push it don so that it is laying on the rice.</li>
			<li>Using the edges of the seran wrap, pull the spam-rice combination out of the can.</li>
			<li>Wrap the nori around the spam-rice combo so that the nori strip is perpendicular to the spam and rice.</li>
			<li>Enjoy!</li>
