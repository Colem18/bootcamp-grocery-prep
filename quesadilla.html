		<p>Quesadillas are a classic in Cole's kitchen. Simple, quick, easy, they're hard to beat. Not to mention there are a lot of ways to customize them and make them better. Today, I'll give you my recipe for a basic cheese quesadilla because I am in college and have no money for fancy stuff like steak</p>

		<h2>What you'll need:</h2>

	<div class="content">
		<ul>
			<li>2 tortillas</li>
			<li>3 cups of a cheese of your choice</li>
			<li>salsa (optional)</li>
			<li>guacamole (optional)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps:</h2>

	<div class="content">
		<ol>
			<li>Pick out a large pan, one that could fit one of the tortillas in it.</li>
			<li>Put the pan over the stove and turn it to medium heat.</li>
			<li>Place one of the tortillas on the pan, making sure it is flat to the bottom.</li>
			<li>Put as much cheese of your choosing as your heart desires onto the tortilla. Just make sure it doesn't exceed the height of the pan. That will not end well.</li>
			<li>Place the second tortilla on top of the cheese.</li>
			<li>Watch for the cheese to melt. Once about half the cheese melts, place a plate face down over the pan. Hold the plate with one hand and flip the pan so that the quesadilla is now on the plate.</li>
			<li>Slowly slide the quesadilla back into the pan so the other side can cook.</li>
			<li>Once the cheese is fully melted, place the quesadilla back on the plate.</li>
			<li>Cut up the quesadilla with scissors. This is the spot where you realize that putting too much cheese may have been a mistake.</li>
			<li>Pour the salsa and the guacamole into their own dipping bowls.</li>
			<li>Enjoy!</li>
