			<li>Add another splash of cooking oil.</li>
			<li>Put your rice into the pan and break it apart with a spatula.</li>
			<li>Once the oil is relatively evenly distributed among the rice, add in a couple splashes of fish sauce and a splash of soy sauce. Flavor to taste.</li>
			<li>Pour your vegetables into the pan and mix the rice until the mixture seems uniform -ish.</li>
			<li>Put the eggs back into the pan and mix the rice again until the mixture is uniform-ish once.</li>
			<li>Once the rice is done being mixed, slice the lime and squeeze its juice onto the rice, making sure to cover as much of it as possible.</li>
			<li>Go over the rice with a pepper shaker, adding as much pepper as you like.</li>
			<li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
